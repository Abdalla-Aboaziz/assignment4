# 🧠 C# Problem Solving Practice

This project contains a large collection of **basic to intermediate C# programming exercises** designed to strengthen problem-solving skills.

It covers:
- Input & Output
- Conditions
- Loops
- Arrays
- Strings
- Mathematical logic
- Simple algorithms

All problems are written inside the `Main()` method and organized using `#region` blocks for better structure.
